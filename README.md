# SQL-Projects-Datamart

In this mini project, we succeeded in answering each case given with the results obtained as follows:

In the first case to determine the total rental income, we use a sum query to obtain the total rental income for each film. In the second case, we succeeded in segmenting customers by using the count command to calculate the frequency of customers borrowing and the sum command to calculate the total rental costs obtained. In the third case, we also managed to obtain information regarding delays in returning films as well as the number of delays for each film returned.
